# Description

The first portions of the PDF document entail a canoncial application of CNNs - facial recognition. Furthermore, we explore the CNN's ability to perform gender classification.

Celebrity images are sourced from the `facescrub` dataset.

The final portion of the paper is more interesting and explores the ability of CNNs to serve as a dimensionality reduction tool. This is intuitive due the recognition abilities of the kernels, and the reduction performed by pooling layers.
